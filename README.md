Concomitant
===========

Concomitant is a framework and set of utilities for testing concurrent code in Java.

This is modelled loosely around the design and principles of William Pugh and Nathaniel Ayewah's [MultithreadedTC](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/multithreadedtc/overview.html), with some further tweaks drawn from Jan Van Besien's [JUnit 4 port](http://janvanbesien.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/modernizing-multithreadedtc-junit-4.html). Concomitant is an attempt to pull these together into a practical framework for testing concurrent mechanisms, primarily for use with Mockito and JUnit 4, with a fluent and intuitive API similar to Mockito's.

Concomitant is currently in the very very early first stages of development.
